# python-blockchain
Little project made for a Campus Contest in Campus Academy.

# More Infos
This individual project was made on 2 days by Enzo BEAUCHAMP. All of this code was written in order to complete a subject given by Kevin NIEL for Campus Academy.
This subject was about Blockchain. The goal was to create our own blockchain, which I tried to do.
The whole project was written in Python.

# Run the project
This was originally designed using Python 3.9.4.

To run the project you just need to download all the code in the repository and launch the main.py file at the root of the project.
This file will show you multiple examples of the working functionalities.

There are some things that you will be able using this project :
* Possibility to create wallets
* Blocks creation in the chain
* Transactions between wallets secured by the blockchain itself
* Earn tokens by mining hashes and creating new blocks on the chain
* Check the history of transactions for one wallet or one specific block in the chain
